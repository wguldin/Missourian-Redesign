	<div class="intro">

	<p>The shells of soon-to-be housing and parking complexes pepper downtown Columbia. The symphony of buzzing drills, pounding hammers, repeated beeping of backing-up trucks and clattering jackhammers accompanies the construction.</p>

	<p>Despite this, there is a shortage of new houses, according to Don Stamper, executive director for both the Central Missouri Development Council and the Home Builder's Association of Columbia.</p>

	<p>Fred Overton, a developer of lots for new subdivisions, is now in the process of selling lots in the Wyndham Ridge Subdivision on the southwest edge of Columbia. This surge in activity has followed the seismic collapse of the housing industry in 2007 that paralyzed development.</p>

	<p>Boone Hospital Center, MU Health Center and Truman Veterans Hospital have spent about $347.5 million on new technology, parking garages, buildings, lobbies and exteriors.</p>

	<p>One thing is clear: Columbia is growing. But that growth is beginning to stretch the fragile fabric of the city's aging infrastructure — and how the city will fund repairs and renovations largely remains unclear.</p>
