Classic Cocktails
In an age when vodka and Red Bull and Bud Light Lime are the drinks of choice, traditional cocktails have almost disappeared from people’s bar tabs. At Sycamore, Manhattans and Old Fashioneds aren’t even on the drink menu, but Head Bartender and Liquor Manager Damien Cooke continues to mix these time-honored drinks. Regulars order them, and Old Fashioneds, in particular, are making a comeback, Cooke says. For your next lunch with liquor or Mad Men watch party, drink like Don Draper, and try out some of these classic cocktail recipes.
